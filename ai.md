Chat was a big help in filling in the gaps of my knowledge on specific CSS, JavaScript, and React things.
I also had them write me a lot of comments because I am bad at commenting and needed to have them there for the things I didn't fully get.
I also tried something that I hadn't done before, which is to have them make me a daily schedule with my outline, which really helped with my procrastination, and I will be doing again.
Something I did not use that I really want to try at some point is WindSurf its like VSCode but with a built in ai and my dad swears by it.
