This is My Music Journal found at https://aaudreya.github.io/My-Music-Journal/.

I made this for music enjoyers and analysts, people who remember their life musically, people who are frustrated by the fact that the genius interpretation of songs is only one interpretation, people who want to capture a loved ones thoughts on some music they love, couples or any other pair of people who want to rember their songs, and just generally people who feel in music and want a music diary. 

This consists of 
- deezer api that provides the
	- database of songs
	- the title
	- the artist
	- the release date
	- the song snippets to jog your memory and take you back to the time you want to write about 

In my data base I have 
- each user with their personal data (a whopping 4 users at this point feel free to be the fifth)
	- their email 
	- their password
	-their playlist
		- every song they have notes for 
		- the data for each song from the api
		- their notes for each song 


I particularly find the song snippets cool because it expanded my understanding of what an api can do, and it is a cool tactical element. I also, for some reason, was unaware you could make multiple pages, which in retrospect makes no sense, but it was cool discovering another cool part of app making. This project also really helped put the puzzle pieces together in my brain, and all the different things that we learned this semester were finally connecting, which felt awesome.

The most challenging part, for some reason, was getting the columns that the different parts of the app reside in, actually, to be columns. This is because the way CSS adds things by default is very horizontal. The other most challenging part was publishing it on GitHub I almost deleted my whole project an hour before it was due. Not fun.

Special shout-out to my dad for saving me from my greatest nemesis, merge conflicts.
